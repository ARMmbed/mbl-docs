## Hardware, software and account environment

Working with Mbed Linux OS requires the following:

* A board from our [supported hardware list](../getting-started/hardware.html).
* A [development environment](../getting-started/environment.html): Operating system, software and an optional virtual environment.
* A Pelion [Device Management account](../getting-started/accounts-and-certificates.html). Once you have the account, you can get:
    * [An API key to your Device Management account](../getting-started/api-keys.html), so you can access the Device Management services.
    * A [developer certificate](../getting-started/provisioning-development.html). It allows your device to connect to your Device Management account, so you can monitor, manage and update your devices.
