## Requirements and development environment

Working with Mbed Linux OS requires the following:

1. A [board from our supported hardware list](supported-hardware.html).
1. A [development environment](preparing-a-development-environment.html): operating system, software, and an optional virtual environment.
1. [A Pelion Device Management account](signing-up-or-logging-in-to-device-management-portal.html).
1. [A developer certificate](provisioning-development.html). This allows your Pelion Device Management to monitor, manage and update your device.
