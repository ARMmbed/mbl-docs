## Hardware, software and account environment

Working with Mbed Linux OS requires the following:

* A board from our [supported hardware list](supported-hardware.html).
* A [development environment](preparing-a-development-environment.html): Operating system, software, and an optional virtual environment.
* A Pelion [Device Management account](signing-up-or-logging-in-to-device-management-portal.html).
* A [developer certificate](provisioning-development.html). This allows you to monitor, manage, and update your devices using Device Management.
