## Requirements and development environment

Working with Mbed Linux OS requires the following:

1. A [supported board](supported-hardware.html).
1. A [development environment](preparing-a-development-environment.html).

    There are two parts to the development environment:

    * Tools to build an MBL image and install it on a device.
    * Tools to build and flash an application to a device that already has MBL.

1. [A Pelion Device Management account](signing-up-or-logging-in-to-device-management-portal.html).
1. [A developer certificate](provisioning-development.html). This allows your Pelion Device Management to monitor, manage and update your device.
