# Partition layout

## Partition types

MBL images contain several types of partition:

- Primary partitions. These partitions have entries in the master boot record
  (MBR), and, in MBL, always contain file systems.
- The extended partition. Since the MBR can only contain entries for four
  partitions, the fourth entry in MBL points to an extended partition that
  holds the first extended boot record (EBR). Each EBR contains an entry for a
  logical partition and, optionally, an entry pointing to another EBR.
- Logical partitions. Logical partitions are partitions that have entries in
  EBRs instead of the MBR. In MBL, logical partitions always contain file
  systems.
- "Raw" partitions. These partitions do not have entries in the MBR or an EBR
  and, in MBL, don't have file systems. A raw partition is used when it
  contains data that needs to be accessible to an early bootloader that does
  not have file system drivers.

## General layout

The partition layout for every board includes at least the following partitions:

| Label/Name        | ro/rw | File system type | Mount point      | Default size | Contains |
|-------------------|-------|------------------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| Bank/Update state | -     | -                | -                | 128MiB       | Unused at this time |
| boot1             | ro    | vfat             | /boot            | 128MiB       | Kernel, device tree and U-Boot boot script |
| boot2             | -     | vfat             | -                | 128MiB       | Unused at this time |
| rootfs1           | rw    | ext4             | /                | 512MiB       | Root file system bank 1 |
| rootfs2           | rw    | ext4             | /                | 512MiB       | Root file system bank 2 |
| factory\_config   | rw    | ext4             | /config/factory  | 32MiB        | Factory configuration |
| nfactory\_config1 | rw    | ext4             | /config/user     | 32MiB        | Nonfactory configuration 1; user data configuration |
| nfactory\_config2 | -     | ext4             | -                | 32MiB        | Unused at this time |
| log               | rw    | ext4             | /var/log         | 128MiB       | Log files |
| scratch           | rw    | ext4             | /scratch         | 640MiB       | Temporary files (such as downloaded firmware files) |
| home              | rw    | ext4             | /home            | 512MiB       | User application storage |

Images also contain partitions for bootloaders, but the details are board specific.

## Customizing the partition layout

You can customize the partition layout by setting variables in your project's `local.conf`. The variables are described in the following table:

| Variable name                     | Description |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `MBL_BOOT_SIZE_MiB`               | The size of each boot partition in MiB. |
| `MBL_ROOT_SIZE_MiB`               | The size of each root partition in MiB. |
| `MBL_FACTORY_CONFIG_SIZE_MiB`     | The size of the factory config partition size in MiB. |
| `MBL_NON_FACTORY_CONFIG_SIZE_MiB` | The size of each nonfactory (user) config partition in MiB. |
| `MBL_LOG_SIZE_MiB`                | The size of the log partition in MiB. |
| `MBL_SCRATCH_SIZE_MiB`            | The size of the scratch partition in MiB. |
| `MBL_HOME_SIZE_MiB`               | The size of the home partition in MiB. |
| `MBL_HOME_FILL_STORAGE`           | When set to "1", the home partition is extended to fill the storage device. |
| `MBL_WKS_STORAGE_SIZE_MiB`        | The size of the flash storage in MiB. For devices with removable storage (e.g. SD cards) you should change this to match the size of storage you use in your project. |
| `MBL_FLASH_ERASE_BLOCK_SIZE_KiB`  | The flash erase block size of the storage in KiB. For devices with removable storage (e.g. SD cards) you should change this to match the flash erase block size of the storage you use in your project. This is used to ensure that partitions are aligned on flash erase block boundaries. |

For the full details, see `meta-mbl-distro/classes/mbl-partitions.bbclass` in
[meta-mbl][meta-mbl], making sure that you select the branch or tag on which
your project is based.


## Rationale

### Requirements

The following high-level requirements drive the plan for MBL's flash memory partition layout:

* Use cases for device firmware update.
* Use cases for application management.
* Secure Boot and firmware verification.
* Use cases for device manufacturing.

In summary, requirements that influence the flash layout are:

| Requirement | Implication |
| --- | --- |
| It should be possible to update all device firmware except for early stage bootloaders. | Components loaded during boot need to start at a block number known by the loading bootloader. |
| A failure during the update process (such as a power loss) should not result in a bricked device. | The previous known good version of a booted component should be maintained in flash until an updated version has been verified to be complete, authentic and viable. This means all booted components should be banked to accommodate both the known good and the updated versions of a component. Writes to one bank of a component should not affect the other bank, and writes to any component should not affect any other components. Due to the nature of flash storage, this means components should not share flash erase blocks with other components or other banks of the same component.|
| A multicomponent update should either be applied in its entirety or not at all. A device should never be left in a state where only a partial update was performed. | Nonvolatile state must be held that reflects the state that a multicomponent update is in progress but is not yet complete. |
| A firmware update involving multiple components may extend across power failures. |	Nonvolatile state must be held reflecting the presence of a component update. Only when all components are installed can the entire update be viewed as complete. |
| Data saved in flash memory that does not need to be modified in normal device operation should be write-protected. |	Some partitions should be created or modified to be read-only. Factory data written during the manufacturing process should be saved in a partition that is modified to read-only when a device boots after its lifecycle state has been modified to 'manufacture complete'. |
| A device should support the restore to factory use case. | To allow the user configuration to be deleted without deleting the factory configuration, the two types of data should be kept separate. |

### Partition alignment

In order to reduce the risk of writes to a single partition having an effect on other
partitions, we aim to ensure that partitions do not share flash erase blocks
(areas of flash that can only be erased in their entirety, not in part). We
therefore, align partitions to flash erase block boundaries where possible.

### MBRs and EBRs

In addition to the actual partitions, the flash device will also contain a
master boot record (MBR) and, for each logical partition, an extended boot
record (EBR). We must take care to ensure that the MBR and EBRs are not
corrupted during device operation, so they must not share flash erase blocks
with data that might be modified. The MBR takes up the first 512B sector of the
storage and it is acceptable for the MBR to share a flash erase block with e.g.
TF-A BL2 because we will not support robust update of BL2. Each EBR takes up
512B and is typically placed immediately before the logical partition it
describes.  We must therefore allocate an extra flash erase block for an EBR
before every logical partition.


### Firmware update

To support firmware updates, MBL has storage for two separate root file systems and a mechanism to select which root file system to boot into after reboots.

A script inside the `initramfs` checks which root partition is currently active; by default, this is `rootfs1`, but the script changes to `rootfs2` if a flag file called `rootfs2` is present in the `bootflags` directory of the `log` partition. In the future, state about banks and firmware updates will be moved to the Bank/Update state partition.

There are also two partitions for each of:
* BL3;
* the Linux kernel;
* the user configuration.

This is to allow robust update of these components in the future.
