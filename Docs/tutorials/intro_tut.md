## Getting started with Mbed Linux OS

To get started with Mbed Linux OS, follow these tutorials in sequence:

1. Build an MBL image that includes Pelion Device Management credentials, and flash it to the device. This section also shows how to set up Wi-Fi connectivity on a device using ConnMan.<!--should this be in the set up bits?--><!--And where in the tutorial should we link to it?-->
1. Add a simple user application ("Hello World") to the device.
1. Update the device over Wi-Fi. You can update either the MBL image itself (from the first tutorial), or the Hello World application (from the second tutorial).

Before starting the tutorials, please make sure [you have everything you need to build images and connect to Device Management](../reqs-setup/index.html).
