# Getting started with Mbed Linux OS (MBL)

To get started with MBL, follow these tutorials in sequence:

1. Build an MBL image that includes Pelion Device Management credentials, and flash it to the device.
1. Set up your network connection, and verify that the device can connect to your Device Management account.
1. Build a simple user application ("Hello World").
1. Add the application to the device using one of these methods:

    * Over Wi-Fi, with the Device Management Update service.
    * Using MBL CLI.

Before starting the tutorials, please make sure you have [everything you need to build images and connect to Device Management](../getting-started/setting-up-and-supported-hardware.html).
