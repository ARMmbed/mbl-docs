## Getting started with Mbed Linux OS

To get started with Mbed Linux OS, follow these tutorials in sequence:

1. Build an MBL image that includes Pelion Device Management credentials, and flash it to the device.
1. Add a simple user application ("Hello World") to the device.
1. Update the device over Wi-Fi. You can update either the MBL image itself (from the first tutorial), or the Hello World application (from the second tutorial).

Before starting the tutorials, please make sure [you have everything you need to build images and connect to Device Management]().
