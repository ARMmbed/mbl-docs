# Mbed Linux OS CLI

The Mbed Linux OS CLI (MBL CLI) is a command-line interface for developing with Mbed Linux OS (MBL). MBL CLI supports  
the following operations on MBL devices:

 * List all available MBL devices on the network.
 * Select a default MBL device for all MBL CLI commands.
 * Get a shell on a device.
 * Copy a file to or from a device.
 * Run a command on a device.
