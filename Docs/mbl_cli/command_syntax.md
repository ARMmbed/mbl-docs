Where `address` is the address of the debug interface on the device or the device's hostname. For example, the address of the `usb0` interface on WaRP7 IoT devices or the address of the `eth1` interface on Raspberry Pi 3 devices.

If the device is [already selected](#device-discovery-and-selection), you can omit the `address` parameter.
