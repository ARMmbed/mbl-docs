# Mbed Linux OS CLI

<span class="notes">**Note**: If you have MBL CLI 1.x installed, please [uninstall it, and install 2.0 instead](../develop-apps/setting-up.html#setting-up-mbl-cli).</span>

The Mbed Linux OS CLI (MBL CLI) is a command-line interface for application developers. It interacts with the MBL device to perform routine development actions:

* List all available MBL devices on the network.
* Select a default MBL device for all MBL CLI commands.
* Get a shell on the device.
* Copy a file to or from the device.
* Run a command on the device.
* Provision the device for Pelion Device Management.
* Install a new application, or update an existing one.

<span class="notes">**Note**: MBL CLI can only be used with devices running the MBL development image `mbl-image-development`, rather than the production image `mbl-image-production`.</span><!--is this for security?-->
