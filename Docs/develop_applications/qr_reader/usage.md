# Build and usage instructions

<span class="tips">**Tip**: You may need to prefix the commands in these instructions with `sudo`</span>

## Dockerizing the application

This application is not MBL-specific; it can run on any operating system. To use it on an MBL device, we wrap the application in an OCI container. To create the OCI container, we dockerize the `example-qr` Python package on a host machine.

To dockerize the application, run:

```
user01@dev-machine:mbl-example-qr$ sh scripts/dockerize-example-qr-app.sh
```

The script:

1. Builds a docker image that includes an installation of the `example-qr` application.
1. Creates the `release` directory.
1. Exports and extracts the filesystem contained in the image to `release/runtime-bundle-filesystem`.

## Setting up the cross-compilation tools

To install the application, the device unpacks an IPK from an application update payload. To build the IPK, use a host machine and cross-compiling toolchains from a dockcross Docker image we provide for ARMv7 architecture. We provide the image in the application's repository.

To set up the cross-compilation tools, run:

```
user01@dev-machine:mbl-example-qr$ sh scripts/setup-cross-compilation-tools.sh
```

The script builds a Docker image with dockcross, adding the `opkg-utils` utility. It also installs a helper script (`build-armv7`) to execute build commands.

## Creating the OCI bundle and generating the IPK

To build the OCI runtime bundle and generate the IPK, run:

```
user01@dev-machine:mbl-example-qr$ build-armv7 make release
```

The build produces an IPK file at `release/ipk/mbl-example-qr_1.0_armv7vet2hf-neon.ipk`.

## Installing and running the application on the device

To install the application on the device:

1. Generate the application update payload:

    ```
    user01@dev-machine:mbl-example-qr$ sh scripts/build-app-update-payload.sh
    ```
1. Choose an installation option and follow its tutorial:

    * [Send the application payload as an over-the-air firmware update with Device Management](../update/index.html).
    * [Flash the application payload over USB with MBL CLI](../update/updating-an-application.html).

After installation, and after every reboot, the application turns on the video camera and waits for QR codes to be presented. It captures one or more QR codes, decodes them to UTF-8, and adds them to the log, in a file named `scanned_qrcodes.log`.

To retrieve previously scanned QR codes:

```
root@mbed-linux-os-1438:~# tail -f /home/app/mbl-example-qr/rootfs/home/scanned_qrcodes.log
```

<span class="tips">**Tip**: MBL redirects the logging information to the log file `/var/log/app/mbl-example-qr.log`.</span>

## Optional: uploading QR codes to Treasure Data

You can modify the application to upload decoded QR codes to Arm Treasure Data.

1. Before [creating the OCI bundle](#creating-oci-bundle-and-ipk):

    1. Create or log into [your Arm Treasure Data account](https://console.treasuredata.com/).
    1. From the Treasure Data console, create a database for your uploaded QR Codes. [Please follow the Treasure Data guidelines](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001266348-Database-and-Table-Management).

    <span class="notes">**Note**: Your database must include at least one table; the table must include at least one column.</span>

    1. Retrieve your [Treasure Data **master** API Key](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000763288-Get-API-Keys).


1. In `src_bundle/config.json`, add an optional argument to pass the API key as `TD_API_KEY`:
    1. Open `example-qr/example_qr/cli.py`.
    1. Modify the `process > args` attribute to include the optional `TD_API_KEY` argument.

    The `args` attribute represents a comma separated shell input. For example, when the OCI container is started, `"args": ["example-qr", "-v", "-l"]` becomes `root@mbl-example-qr-oci-container:/# example-qr -v -l` within the OCI container.


## Cleaning the build artefacts

To clean the content of the [`release`](release/) directory, run:

```
user01@dev-machine:mbl-example-qr$ make clean
```
