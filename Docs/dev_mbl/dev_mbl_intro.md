# Contributing to Mbed Linux OS

We expect most MBL contributions to be Board Support Package (BSP) layers and fixes on top of the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/), and recommend reading their [development guides](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/).

<!--missing: Some docs on a development environment and how you can work on bits and pieces-->

If you intend to contribute, please review our [contribution guidelines](../develop-mbl/contribution-guidelines.html) and our coding style guides for [C++](../develop-mbl/c-coding-style-guide.html) and [Python](../develop-mbl/python-coding-style-guide.html). We also have [pytest guidelines](../develop-mbl/pytest-in-mbl.html).
