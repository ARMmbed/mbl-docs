# Writing and booting the disk image

This section contains instructions for writing the full disk image to officially supported devices:

* [PICO-PI with an IMX7D SoM](../first-image/pico-pi.html).
* [NXP 8M Mini EVK](../first-image/nxp-evk.html).
* [Warp7](../first-image/warp7.html).
* [Raspberry Pi 3B or 3B+](../first-image/raspberry-pi-3.html).

<!-- JIJ: I think we could refactor this (possibly) as the instructions to find out which device to flash to, could be the same as the new instructions I have written - they would work for SDcard, Warp7 or Pico or IMX8 - i.e. using lsblk, and the following instructions on unmount, bmap-tool and eject would then be all identical. Its just the plugging in, and the rebooting that is different -->
