# Hardware, software and account environment

Building MBL images for devices requires the following:

* A board from our [supported hardware list](../first-image/hardware.html).
* A [development environment](../first-image/development-environment.html): Operating system, software and an optional virtual environment.
* A Pelion [Device Management account](https://os.mbed.com/account/login/). Once you have the account, you can [provision your device so it can connect to that account and use Device Management services](../first-image/pelion-device-management-accounts-and-certificates.html).
