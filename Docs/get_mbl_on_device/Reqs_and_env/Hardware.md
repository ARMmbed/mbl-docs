# Supported hardware

Supported boards:

* [NXP Warp7](https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/nxp-designs/warp7-next-generation-iot-and-wearable-development-platform:WARP7). You also need two micro-USB cables.
* [Raspberry Pi 3 models B or B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/), with:

    * A micro-SD card.
    * An C232HD-DDHSP-0 cable to connect the GPIO to a PC's USB (for debugging).
    * If you want to use MBL CLI: a USB to network adaptor and an RJ45 network cable (to convert from RPi3 USB host port to network). We've tested with the TP-Link UE300.

         An optional second USB network adaptor if you want to convert back to USB (to connect to your PC over USB rather than network).

    <span class="warnings">**Warning:** The Raspberry Pi 3 is suitable for development only. Do not use it for production.</span>
