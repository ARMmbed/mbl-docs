# Writing and booting the disk image

This section contains instructions for writing the full disk image to a:

* Warp7 device.
* Raspberry Pi 3 device.

<!-- JIJ: Need a section on first time writing for Pico7 and imx8mm -->

## PICO-PI baseboard with the PICO-IMX7D SoM

### First-time

<span class="notes">This assumes you have already assembled your baseboard and SoM. These first-time instructions are distilled from [information from TechNexion](https://www.technexion.com/support/knowledgebase/loading-bootable-software-images-onto-the-emmc-of-picosom-on-pico-pi/).</span>

To write your first disk image, you need to:

1. Download and unzip the TechNexion image loader software: [ftp://download.technexion.net/development_resources/development_tools/installer/pico-imx6-imx6ul-imx7_otg-installer_20171101.zip](ftp://download.technexion.net/development_resources/development_tools/installer/pico-imx6-imx6ul-imx7_otg-installer_20171101.zip)

1. Set the PICO-PI into serial download mode by chainging the boot configuration jumper settings.

<!--JIJ:picture TBD-->

1. Connect both the PICO-PI-GL USB-C socket and the micro-USB socket to your PC.

    You should now be able to see a USB TTY device, such as, `/dev/ttyUSB0`, on your PC.

1. Connect to the PICO-PI-GL's console using a command such as:

    ```
    minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
    ```

    Use the following settings:

    * Baud rate: 115200.
    * Encdoing: [8N1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-N-1).
    * No hardware flow control (enabled by default).
    
1. Run the USB OTG (on the go) Loader, using the following commands on Linux:

    ```
    cd pico-imx6-imx6ul-imx7_otg-installer_20171101
    sudo linux/imx_usb pico-imx7d_bootbomb_20170112.imx 
    ```
    
    TBD!

## Warp7 devices

To write your disk image to the Warp7's flash device, you must first access the Warp7's serial console. To do this:

1. Connect both the Warp7's USB socket (on the I/O board) and the Warp7's mass storage USB socket (on the CPU board) to your PC.

    You should now be able to see a USB TTY device, such as, `/dev/ttyUSB0`, on your PC.

1. Connect to the Warp7's console using a command such as:

    ```
    minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
    ```

    Use the following settings:

    * Baud rate: 115200.
    * Encdoing: [8N1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-N-1).
    * No hardware flow control (enabled by default).

1. Check the current storage devices on your PC:

    ```
    ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
    ```

    A list of devices displays. For example:

    ```
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Mar 19 10:38 ata-Crucial_CT240M500SSD1_140709691C39 -> ../../sda
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 19 10:38 ata-Crucial_CT240M500SSD1_140709691C39-part1 -> ../../sda1
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 19 10:38 ata-Crucial_CT240M500SSD1_140709691C39-part2 -> ../../sda2
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 19 10:38 ata-Crucial_CT240M500SSD1_140709691C39-part3 -> ../../sda3
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Mar 19 10:38 ata-HL-DT-ST_DVD+_-RW_GHB0N_K8RD9II5408 -> ../../sr0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Mar 19 10:38 ata-ST1000DM003-1CH162_W1D2QL7A -> ../../sdb
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 19 10:38 ata-ST1000DM003-1CH162_W1D2QL7A-part1 -> ../../sdb1
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 19 10:38 ata-ST1000DM003-1CH162_W1D2QL7A-part2 -> ../../sdb2
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 19 10:38 ata-ST1000DM003-1CH162_W1D2QL7A-part3 -> ../../sdb3
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 19 10:38 ata-ST1000DM003-1CH162_W1D2QL7A-part4 -> ../../sdb4
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 19 10:38 ata-ST1000DM003-1CH162_W1D2QL7A-part5 -> ../../sdb5
    ```

    You'll need to refer to this output in the following steps, so save it for reference.

1. If you got a U-boot prompt on the device, continue to the next step.

   If you got an operating system boot (for example, Android), reboot the device until you get a U-boot prompt, and then press any key to prevent the operating system from booting again. Continue to the next step.

1. To expose the Warp7's flash device to Linux as USB mass storage, in the U-boot prompt, enter:

    ```
    ums 0 mmc 0
    ```

    On the Warp7, you now see an ASCII-art "spinner". On your PC, you now see new storage devices:

    ```
    ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
    ```

    In this example, the Warp7 is listed as `usb-Linux_UMS_disk_0` (the partitions on the device are also shown):

    ```

    ```

    `mbl-image-development-imx7s-warp-mbl.wic.gz` is a full disk image, so it should be written to the whole flash device, not a partition.

    The device file for the whole flash device is the one without `-part` in the name (`/dev/disk/by-id/usb-Linux_UMS_disk_0-0:0` in this example).

1. Ensure that none of the Warp7's flash partitions are mounted (you may need to adjust the path depending on the name of the storage device):

    ```
    sudo umount /dev/disk/by-id/usb-Linux_UMS_disk_0-0:0-part*
    ```

1. From a Linux prompt, write the disk image to the Warp7's flash device (replace `<device-file-name>` with the correct device file for the Warp7's flash device; in this example, it would be `usb-Linux_UMS_disk_0-0:0`):

    ```
    sudo bmaptool copy --nobmap /path/to/artifacts/machine/imx7s-warp-mbl/images/mbl-image-development/images/mbl-image-development-imx7s-warp-mbl.wic.gz /dev/disk/by-id/<device-file-name>
    ```

    This action may take some time.

    <span class="tips">**Tip**: Use `--nobmap` for the initial flashing, to ensure your flash is set up correctly. On all subsequent flashings, you can use the `--bmap` option with a bmap file to speed up the process: `sudo bmaptool copy --bmap /path/to/artifacts/machine/imx7s-warp-mbl/images/mbl-image-development/images/mbl-image-development-imx7s-warp-mbl.wic.bmap /path/to/artifacts/machine/imx7s-warp-mbl/images/mbl-image-development/images/mbl-image-development-imx7s-warp-mbl.wic.gz /dev/disk/by-id/<device-file-name>`</span>

1. When `bmaptool` has finished, eject the device (replace `<device-file-name>` with the correct device file for the Warp7's flash device; in this example, it would be `usb-Linux_UMS_disk_0-0:0`):

    ```
    sudo eject /dev/disk/by-id/<device-file-name>
    ```

1. On the Warp7's U-boot prompt, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> to exit USB mass storage mode.
1. Reboot the Warp7:

    ```
    reset
    ```

    The device now boots into MBL.

## Raspberry Pi 3 devices

1. Connect a micro-SD card to your PC. You now see:

    * The SD card device file in `/dev`, probably as `/dev/sdX` for some letter `X` (for example, `/dev/sdd`).
    * Device files for its partitions. `/dev/sdXN` for the same letter `X` and some numbers `N` (for example, `/dev/sdd1` and `/dev/sdd2`).

    <span class="notes">In the commands below, replace `/dev/sdX` with the device file name for the SD card _without_ a number at the end. You can use `lsblk` to identify the name of the SD card device.</span>

1. Ensure none of the micro-SD card's partitions are mounted (replace `/dev/sdX` as explained above):

    ```
    sudo umount /dev/sdX*
    ```

1. Write the disk image to the SD card device - not a partition on it (replace `/dev/sdX` as explained above):

    ```
    sudo bmaptool copy --nobmap /path/to/artifacts/machine/raspberrypi3-mbl/images/mbl-image-development/images/mbl-image-development-raspberrypi3-mbl.wic.gz /dev/sdX
    ```

    This action may take some time.

    <span class="tips">**Tip**: Use `--nobmap` for the initial flashing, to ensure your flash is set up correctly. On all subsequent flashings, you can use the `--bmap` option with a bmap file to speed up the process: `sudo bmaptool copy --bmap /path/to/artifacts/machine/raspberrypi3-mbl/images/mbl-image-development/images/mbl-image-development-raspberrypi3-mbl.wic.bmap /path/to/artifacts/machine/raspberrypi3-mbl/images/mbl-image-development/images/mbl-image-development-raspberrypi3-mbl.wic.gz /dev/sdX`</span>

1. When `bmaptool` has finished, eject the device:

    ```
    sudo eject /dev/sdX
    ```

1. Detach the micro-SD card from your PC, and plug it into the Raspberry Pi 3.
1. You need access to the device's console, so before powering it on, either:

    * Connect it to a monitor and keyboard (using its HDMI and USB sockets).
    * Connect it to your PC. For example, if you're using a [C232HD-DDHSP-0](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_C232HD_UART_CABLE.pdf) cable, use [this pin numbering reference](https://www.element14.com/community/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/73950-102-10-339300/pi3_gpio.png) and connect USB-UART colored wires:
       * **Grounds** wire (usually black) to pin **06**.
       * **Tx** wire (usually yellow) to pin **08**.
       * **Rx** wire (usually orange) to pin **10**.

    Connect the other end of the C232HD-DDHSP-0 cable to the USB port on your PC.

    The cable's TX and RX are used to communicate with the board.

1. After connecting the Raspberry Pi 3, from your PC, run the following command to connect to the device's serial console:

    ```
    minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
    ```

    Use the following settings:

    * Baud rate: 115200.
    * Encoding: [8N1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-N-1).
    * No hardware flow control (enabled by default).

1. Connect the Raspberry Pi 3's micro-USB socket to a USB power supply.

    The device now boots into MBL.

## Logging in to MBL

To log in to MBL, wait for a login prompt, and then enter the username `root`. You will not be prompted for a password.
